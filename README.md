# JSBasics-MazeGame
An in-browser maze game made with Matter.js and DOM manipulation. From the Colt Steele Modern JS Course on Udemy.

## Things I Learned
* Implemented a 2D physics engine using Matter.js to control the character (circle) movement and ascertain when it touches the finish line
* Randomized the maze layout on each refresh and had the maze resize based on the window size (on refresh) to fill the whole window
* Used Matter.js to create a maze collapse animation on the win condition

## To-Do List
- [ ] Add a Timer and logic to add a Game Over if the end isn't reached before it ends
- [ ] Add sounds when the character collides with walls and when the character reaches the finish
- [ ] Add an option to play mazes of different difficulty/complexity
- [ ] \(Optional) Add a color theme picker to change the styling to the maze
