# A-Maze-ing
A-Maze-ing is an in-browser maze game made with Matter.js and DOM manipulation.

## Stack
* Matter.js
  * Implemented a 2D physics engine using Matter.js to control the character (circle) movement and ascertain when it touches the finish line
  * Created a maze collapse animation on the win condition 
* JavaScript
  * Randomized the maze layout on each refresh and had the maze resize based on the window size (on refresh) to fill the whole window
